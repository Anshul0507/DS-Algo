Clarification in the exp: the two values should be:
​
the min value
the smallest second value: the smallest value that has something before it that is even smaller. That 'something before it that is even smaller' does not have to be the current min value.
Example:
3,2,1,4,0,5
​
When you see 5, min value is 0, and the smallest second value is 4, which is not after the current min value.
